        <h2>who am i?</h2>

        <p>
            It took me a few years to decide what I wanted to be when I grow up.
            After spending my upper secondary school going from computer science to music production and live audio
            followed by a few internships in the field I realized that music was too much of a passion for me to compete
            in the market.
            Now I am back to computers, or studying how to manipulate them. I have always been somewhat of a nerd.
        </p>

        <H3>a few points that makes me, me:</H3>

        <h3>I am a huge music nerd</h3>
        <div class="point-text " >Every year I keep racking up 100 000+ minutes on my Spotify wrapped and I own more music
            instruments than I am willing to openly admit.
        </div>

        <h3>International mindset</h3>
        <div class="point-text">Expats in Sweden connect well with me. I connect well with expats. More than once I have become their "in
            between" when they experience nordic behaviour and culture.
        </div>

        <h3>My dream: Travel by living - with a base in Stockholm</h3>
        <div class="point-text">I want to see as much of the world as possible. But not as a tourist. As a local. Being
            able to spend 3+ months in a place while working seems like the perfect way to achieve this.
        </div>

        <h3>Open source aficionado</h3>
        <div class="point-text">Openly auditable services and products are important to create trust and transparency.
        </div>

        <h3>Design minded</h3>
        <div class="point-text">Good design makes a service or product intuitive. Intuition is a powerful tool.</div>

        <h3>Privacy concious</h3>
        <div class="point-text">Swedes usually looks at me as if I am about to put on a tin foil hat whenever I mention
            privacy. But I am not, I just try to adapt to a somewhat privacy conscious lifestyle.
